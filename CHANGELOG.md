# Changelog

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and
the numbers follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

While the major number is 0, a minor bump may break something. From 1.0.0 the
usual promise applies: a patch fixes, a minor adds, a major breaks.

## Unreleased

## 0.2.0 — 2026-08-22

### Added

- `DATABASE_POOL_MAX`. One process held up to twelve connections and there was
  no way to say otherwise. That is fine for a database of Ushabti's own, and
  wrong on a managed cluster shared with other applications, where the whole
  server may allow only 25. The default has not changed.

### Note for anyone on a managed database

`node-postgres` verifies the certificate when the connection string says
`sslmode=require`, which is stricter than libpq and stricter than most other
drivers. On DigitalOcean and similar, pass the provider's CA and ask for
`sslmode=verify-full&sslrootcert=/path/to/ca.crt`.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-08-22

The first release.

### Added

- Email and password sign-in. Projects with members, added by email.
- Custom properties: select, multi-select, person, text, number, date and
  checkbox. No field on a task is hardcoded, not even Status.
- Views. Each one is a board grouped by a select, person or checkbox property.
- Drag and drop for cards and for columns, with the pointer or the keyboard.
- Task detail: markdown description, checklist, comments and an activity log.
- Live updates over server-sent events.
- Docker Compose for development, a production image on Docker Hub and on the
  GitHub registry, and migrations that run when the container starts.
- 14 unit tests and 18 end-to-end tests, run on every pull request together with
  ESLint, Prettier, the types, the production build and a CodeQL scan.

### Built on

Next.js 16 with Turbopack, React 19, PostgreSQL 18 with Drizzle, Node 24.

### Known limits

- Eight warnings from `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect`. The pattern works but
  is worth removing.
- One card order for all views, no rate limit on sign-in, no password reset.
  The end of [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) has the full list.
